     <p >The 12 zodiac signs, also known as animal signs, <br>
      are the 12 Chinese animals that match the year of human birth with the 12 terrestrial branches,<br>
      including the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig.<br>
      The origin of the Chinese zodiac is related to animal worship.</p> <!-- Write your HTML in this file! -->
     <p>With the development of history, it has been gradually integrated into the folk belief concept of mutual survival and mutual harmony,
       which is manifested in marriage, life and year fortune.<br> 
       Each zodiac animal has a rich legend, and thus forms a concept interpretation system,<br>
       which has become the image philosophy in folk culture, such as the zodiac sign in marriage,<br>
       temple prayer, and the year of the zodiac, etc. In modern times, <br>
       more people take the zodiac as the mascot of the Spring Festival and become a symbol of entertainment and cultural activities.</p>
