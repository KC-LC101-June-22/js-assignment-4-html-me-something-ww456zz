      <p >The 12 zodiac signs, also known as animal signs,
         are the 12 Chinese animals that match the year of human birth with the 12 terrestrial branches,
         including the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig.
         The origin of the Chinese zodiac is related to animal worship.</p> <!-- Write your HTML in this file! -->
      <p>With the development of history, it has been gradually integrated into the folk belief concept of mutual survival and mutual harmony,
         which is manifested in marriage, life and year fortune.
         Each zodiac animal has a rich legend, and thus forms a concept interpretation system,
         which has become the image philosophy in folk culture, such as the zodiac sign in marriage,
         temple prayer, and the year of the zodiac, etc. In modern times,
         more people take the zodiac as the mascot of the Spring Festival and become a symbol of entertainment and cultural activities.</p>
